ShadowSweep ‚Äì Android Threat Analysis Tool

ShadowSweep is a Python-based forensic tool for Android threat detection and analysis.
It was developed as part of an internship project at Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW).

The tool detects hidden apps, malware, and suspicious behavior by analyzing Android device logs.
It also integrates OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) techniques such as WHOIS, IP lookups, and dark web scanning (via Tor), presented through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.
